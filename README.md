# Best Delivery Routes for Amazon Drivers

## Overview:

The development of online e-commerce has brought great convenience to people's lives. It has now become the mainstream way of shopping. When we receive online shopping deliveries, we are sure that the delivery personnel have the best delivery route for the day before they set out. So, how is this best route calculated?

With this question in mind, we introduce our topic. A delivery driver from Amazon, in the morning, departs from the delivery station, finds the best delivery route among the various destinations in the community, completes the parcel delivery, and ultimately returns to the delivery station.

In 2021, Amazon Logistics delivered approximately 4.75 billion packages in the United States (U.S.). Faced with such a massive volume of package deliveries, optimizing the delivery routes for couriers not only helps them deliver packages to customers more promptly but also assists the company in reducing operational costs. Furthermore, helping couriers find the best delivery routes conserves energy consumption in delivery vehicles, contributing to environmental preservation.
